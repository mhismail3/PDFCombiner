# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create document reordering interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering entire documents in the combination sequence.
# Details:
Implement drag-and-drop functionality for document reordering using React DnD or similar library. Create visual indicators for drag operations and drop targets. Maintain document order state that will be used for the final PDF combination. Add keyboard shortcuts for moving documents up/down in the sequence. Ensure drag operations work smoothly with appropriate animations and feedback. Implement undo/redo functionality for reordering operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test drag-and-drop reordering with mouse and touch interactions. Verify keyboard shortcuts work correctly. Ensure the final document order is correctly maintained in state. Test undo/redo functionality for reordering operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up React DnD library and basic document list component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure React DnD library and create the basic document list component structure that will support drag and drop functionality.
### Details:
1. Install React DnD and its HTML5 backend: `npm install react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend`
2. Set up DnD context provider in the application
3. Create a DocumentList component to display the list of documents
4. Implement a Document component that will be draggable
5. Create initial state management for document order using React state or context
6. Test the basic rendering of documents without drag functionality
7. Ensure the component structure is accessible and works with screen readers

## 2. Implement drag and drop functionality with visual indicators [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Add drag and drop capabilities to the document list with appropriate visual feedback during drag operations.
### Details:
1. Define drag sources for document items using React DnD's useDrag hook
2. Implement drop targets using useDrops hook
3. Create visual indicators for:
   - Items being dragged (opacity change, shadow)
   - Drop zones (highlighted areas, gap indicators)
   - Invalid drop targets
4. Add smooth CSS transitions for drag operations
5. Implement the reordering logic when items are dropped
6. Test drag and drop functionality across different positions in the list
7. Ensure visual indicators are clear and provide good user feedback

## 3. Implement document order state management and persistence [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create a robust state management system for document order that persists changes and can be used for final PDF combination.
### Details:
1. Refine the state management approach (use Redux or Context API if not already implemented)
2. Create actions/reducers for document reordering operations
3. Implement functions to:
   - Move documents up/down
   - Insert documents at specific positions
   - Remove documents from the sequence
4. Add persistence of document order (localStorage or backend API)
5. Create a mechanism to retrieve the current order for PDF combination
6. Test state updates with various reordering scenarios
7. Ensure state consistency across component re-renders

## 4. Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement keyboard shortcuts for document reordering and ensure the interface is fully accessible.
### Details:
1. Add keyboard shortcuts for:
   - Moving documents up (Alt+Up or similar)
   - Moving documents down (Alt+Down or similar)
   - Moving to top/bottom of list
2. Create a keyboard shortcut help modal or tooltip
3. Implement focus management during keyboard operations
4. Add ARIA attributes for drag and drop operations
5. Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate roles and labels
6. Test keyboard navigation thoroughly
7. Verify accessibility with screen readers and automated testing tools

## 5. Implement undo/redo functionality for reordering operations [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create an undo/redo system that allows users to reverse or replay document reordering actions.
### Details:
1. Design a command pattern or history stack for tracking reordering operations
2. Implement undo and redo functions that restore previous/next states
3. Add keyboard shortcuts for undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z)
4. Create UI buttons for undo/redo operations
5. Add visual feedback when undo/redo is performed
6. Implement state management for the history stack
7. Test complex sequences of operations with undo/redo
8. Ensure history state is properly maintained during session
