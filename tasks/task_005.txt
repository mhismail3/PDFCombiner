# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate PDF.js for thumbnail generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement PDF parsing and thumbnail generation for uploaded PDF files using PDF.js.
# Details:
Integrate PDF.js library for client-side PDF parsing. Implement functions to extract page data and generate thumbnails for each page. Create a thumbnail rendering component with appropriate sizing and layout. Implement progressive loading for large documents to maintain performance. Use Web Workers for background processing of thumbnails to keep the UI responsive. Add placeholder states for thumbnails during loading.

# Test Strategy:
Test thumbnail generation with various PDF files (different versions, sizes, and page counts). Verify thumbnails render correctly and represent actual PDF content. Measure performance impact and ensure UI remains responsive during processing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up PDF.js library and basic integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add PDF.js to the project and create a basic wrapper for PDF parsing functionality
### Details:
1. Install PDF.js via npm or yarn (pdfjs-dist package)
2. Create a PDFService utility class with methods for loading PDF documents
3. Implement a basic loadDocument method that takes a file or URL and returns a PDF.js document instance
4. Set up the PDF.js worker to ensure proper threading
5. Add error handling for failed document loading
6. Test by loading a sample PDF and verifying the document metadata is accessible

Based on the existing PDF.js integration in pdfUtils.ts, here's how to enhance the PDF service functionality:

```typescript
// Consider creating a more comprehensive PDFService class:
export class PDFService {
  private worker: any;
  
  constructor() {
    // Initialize worker only once for better performance
    pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/${pdfjsLib.version}/pdf.worker.min.js`;
    this.worker = new pdfjsLib.PDFWorker('pdf-service-worker');
  }

  async loadDocument(source: string | Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer): Promise<pdfjsLib.PDFDocumentProxy> {
    try {
      const loadingTask = pdfjsLib.getDocument({
        data: typeof source === 'string' ? undefined : source,
        url: typeof source === 'string' ? source : undefined,
        worker: this.worker,
        cMapUrl: 'https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/cmaps/',
        cMapPacked: true,
      });
      
      return await loadingTask.promise;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load PDF document:', error);
      throw new Error(`PDF loading failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }

  // Add methods to extract existing functionality from pdfUtils.ts
  async getPageCount(document: pdfjsLib.PDFDocumentProxy): Promise<number> {
    return document.numPages;
  }
  
  async getDocumentMetadata(document: pdfjsLib.PDFDocumentProxy): Promise<any> {
    return await document.getMetadata();
  }
  
  // Method to properly clean up resources
  destroy() {
    if (this.worker) {
      this.worker.destroy();
    }
  }
}
```

Integrate with existing code by refactoring pdfUtils.ts to use this service, ensuring memory management by properly destroying documents when done. Consider adding a singleton instance for app-wide PDF operations.

## 2. Implement page data extraction functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create functions to extract page data from loaded PDF documents
### Details:
1. Extend the PDFService with methods to get page count and access individual pages
2. Create a getPageData method that extracts text content, dimensions, and other metadata from a specific page
3. Implement a function to determine the optimal scale for thumbnail rendering based on desired dimensions
4. Add caching for page data to improve performance for repeated access
5. Test by extracting and logging page data from different types of PDFs
6. Ensure proper memory management by releasing page resources when no longer needed

## 3. Create thumbnail rendering component [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Build a reusable component for rendering PDF page thumbnails with appropriate sizing and layout
### Details:
1. Create a PDFThumbnail component that takes page data and desired dimensions as props
2. Implement canvas-based rendering using PDF.js page.render() method
3. Add support for different sizing modes (fit width, fit height, etc.)
4. Implement proper scaling to ensure crisp rendering at different zoom levels
5. Add placeholder/loading state for thumbnails
6. Style the component with appropriate borders, shadows, and hover effects
7. Test rendering thumbnails of various page sizes and orientations

## 4. Implement Web Workers for background processing [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Set up Web Workers to handle thumbnail generation in the background to keep the UI responsive
### Details:
1. Create a dedicated worker script for PDF processing tasks
2. Move the thumbnail generation logic to the worker
3. Implement message passing between the main thread and worker
4. Set up a queue system in the worker to process thumbnail requests sequentially
5. Add progress reporting from the worker to the main thread
6. Implement error handling and recovery for worker operations
7. Test with large PDFs to verify UI responsiveness during processing
8. Add fallback for browsers that don't support Web Workers

## 5. Implement progressive loading for large documents [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Create a system for progressively loading and rendering thumbnails for large PDF documents
### Details:
1. Implement a virtualized list/grid component to display only visible thumbnails
2. Create a priority queue system that prioritizes rendering visible thumbnails first
3. Add pagination or infinite scrolling for large documents
4. Implement thumbnail caching to avoid re-rendering already processed pages
5. Add a document overview mode that shows a zoomed-out view of all pages
6. Implement memory management to release resources for off-screen thumbnails
7. Test with very large PDFs (100+ pages) to verify performance
8. Add user feedback for loading progress (progress bar, count of loaded/total pages)

## 6. Implement progressive loading for large documents [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create optimized components for displaying large PDFs by implementing virtual scrolling, progressive loading, and memory management techniques to maintain performance.

2. Implement memory management to unload off-screen thumbnails when not visible
3. Add pagination controls for efficient navigation in large documents
4. Create cache management to preserve rendered thumbnails while preventing memory leaks
5. Add proper scroll position restoration when returning to a document
6. Include performance optimizations for handling documents with 1000+ pages
