# Title: Integrate PDF.js for thumbnail generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement PDF parsing and thumbnail generation for uploaded PDF files using PDF.js.
# Details:
Integrate PDF.js library for client-side PDF parsing. Implement functions to extract page data and generate thumbnails for each page. Create a thumbnail rendering component with appropriate sizing and layout. Implement progressive loading for large documents to maintain performance. Use Web Workers for background processing of thumbnails to keep the UI responsive. Add placeholder states for thumbnails during loading.

# Test Strategy:
Test thumbnail generation with various PDF files (different versions, sizes, and page counts). Verify thumbnails render correctly and represent actual PDF content. Measure performance impact and ensure UI remains responsive during processing.
