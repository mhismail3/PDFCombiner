# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement page-level selection and organization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality for selecting, deselecting, and reordering individual pages from the uploaded documents.
# Details:
Extend the document preview to allow selection of individual pages. Implement checkboxes or toggle controls for page selection. Add drag-and-drop functionality for reordering pages across documents. Create a page range selector for quickly selecting multiple pages. Implement visual indicators for selected/deselected pages. Maintain page selection and order state for final PDF combination. Add context menu for common page operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test page selection, deselection, and reordering. Verify page range selection works correctly. Ensure selected pages are visually distinct. Test that page order is correctly maintained in state for processing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement page selection UI with checkboxes and visual indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add checkboxes to each page in the document preview and implement visual indicators to show selected/deselected state.
### Details:
1. Add a checkbox component to each page thumbnail in the document preview.
2. Implement state management to track selected pages (using React state or Redux).
3. Create CSS styles for visual indicators - add an overlay or border for selected pages.
4. Implement click handlers for both the checkbox and the page thumbnail itself.
5. Ensure keyboard accessibility for selection (tab navigation and space/enter to select).
6. Add unit tests for the selection component and integration tests for selection behavior.
7. Test across different browsers and screen sizes to ensure consistent behavior.

## 2. Create page range selection functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement a page range selector that allows users to quickly select multiple consecutive pages at once.
### Details:
1. Design and implement a range selector UI component (e.g., 'Select pages 3-7').
2. Add input fields for start and end page numbers with validation.
3. Implement a 'Select Range' button that triggers the range selection.
4. Update the existing page selection state when a range is selected.
5. Add keyboard shortcuts for common range operations (e.g., Shift+click for range selection).
6. Implement error handling for invalid ranges (e.g., end page < start page).
7. Add unit tests for range validation and selection behavior.
8. Test with documents of varying page counts to ensure proper functionality.

## 3. Implement drag-and-drop for page reordering [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Add drag-and-drop functionality to allow users to reorder pages within and across documents.
### Details:
1. Integrate a drag-and-drop library (e.g., react-beautiful-dnd or react-dnd).
2. Make page thumbnails draggable elements.
3. Create drop zones between pages and at the beginning/end of documents.
4. Implement the state updates when pages are reordered.
5. Add visual cues during drag operations (e.g., placeholder, drop indicators).
6. Handle edge cases like dragging between different documents.
7. Ensure the page order state is maintained for final PDF combination.
8. Add automated tests for the drag-and-drop functionality.
9. Test performance with large documents (many pages) to ensure smooth operation.

## 4. Create context menu for page operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement a context menu that appears on right-click, providing quick access to common page operations.
### Details:
1. Design the context menu UI with options like 'Select', 'Deselect', 'Select All', 'Deselect All', 'Delete', 'Rotate', etc.
2. Implement the context menu component that appears on right-click on a page.
3. Position the menu correctly relative to the cursor and viewport boundaries.
4. Implement handlers for each menu option to perform the corresponding action.
5. Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations and display them in the menu.
6. Ensure the menu is accessible and can be navigated with keyboard.
7. Close the menu when clicking outside or pressing Escape.
8. Add unit tests for each menu operation.
9. Test on different devices including touch screens (convert to long-press).

## 5. Implement state persistence for page selection and order [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create a system to maintain the page selection and order state that will be used for the final PDF combination.
### Details:
1. Design a data structure to efficiently store page selection and order information.
2. Implement state management to track selected pages and their order across user sessions.
3. Create functions to convert the selection/order state into a format usable by the PDF combination functionality.
4. Add methods to serialize the state for saving/loading user selections.
5. Implement automatic state saving (e.g., to localStorage or backend).
6. Create a preview mode that shows only selected pages in their final order.
7. Add unit tests for state management and serialization/deserialization.
8. Perform integration testing with the PDF combination functionality to ensure selected pages appear in the correct order in the final document.
