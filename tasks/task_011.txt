# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement WebAssembly optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize PDF processing performance by implementing WebAssembly for core PDF manipulation operations.
# Details:
Research and select appropriate WebAssembly-compatible PDF processing libraries. Integrate WebAssembly modules for PDF parsing, manipulation, and merging. Implement feature detection to use WebAssembly when available with JavaScript fallbacks. Create benchmarking tools to measure performance improvements. Optimize memory usage during processing to handle larger documents. Implement progressive processing for large documents to maintain responsiveness.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance benchmarks comparing WebAssembly vs. JavaScript implementation. Test with various file sizes and complexities. Verify feature detection and fallbacks work correctly across browsers. Monitor memory usage during processing of large files.
