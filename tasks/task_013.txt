# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement the ability to generate temporary shareable links for combined PDF documents.
# Details:
Set up temporary cloud storage for processed files (S3 or similar). Implement secure link generation with UUID or similar unique identifiers. Add 24-hour expiration for all shared files with automatic cleanup. Create copy-to-clipboard functionality for sharing links. Implement link preview and metadata for shared files. Add analytics tracking for link usage (optional). Ensure shared links work across devices and browsers.

# Test Strategy:
Test link generation and access from different devices and browsers. Verify 24-hour expiration works correctly. Test copy-to-clipboard functionality. Ensure shared files are properly removed after expiration. Verify security of the sharing mechanism.
