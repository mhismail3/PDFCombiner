# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement document preview functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a preview interface that displays thumbnails of all uploaded PDF documents and their pages.
# Details:
Develop a preview panel that displays thumbnails in a grid or list layout. Implement document grouping to visually separate different uploaded files. Add metadata display (filename, page count) for each document. Create pagination or virtual scrolling for efficient rendering of many thumbnails. Implement zoom controls for thumbnail size adjustment. Ensure preview area is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Test preview functionality with multiple documents of varying page counts. Verify all thumbnails load correctly. Test performance with large numbers of pages. Ensure responsive behavior on different screen sizes.
