# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up React SPA project structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the React single-page application with necessary dependencies and project structure for the PDF Combiner application.
# Details:
Create a new React project using Create React App or Next.js. Install core dependencies including React Router for navigation, a state management solution (Redux or Context API), and styling libraries (TailwindCSS recommended for responsive design). Set up the basic folder structure following best practices with components, hooks, utils, and services directories. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore file.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the application builds and runs without errors. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and the development environment is functioning properly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize React project with Create React App [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the base React application using Create React App with TypeScript template and configure the initial project settings
### Details:
1. Install the latest version of Node.js and npm
2. Run `npx create-react-app pdf-combiner --template typescript` to create a new React project with TypeScript
3. Clean up the default files (remove logo, unnecessary CSS)
4. Update the title and metadata in index.html and manifest.json
5. Create a basic App.tsx component with a simple header
6. Test the application by running `npm start` to ensure it builds and runs correctly

## 2. Install and configure essential dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add necessary libraries for routing, state management, and styling to the project
### Details:
1. Install React Router: `npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom`
2. Install state management: `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux @types/react-redux`
3. Install TailwindCSS: `npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
4. Initialize TailwindCSS: `npx tailwindcss init -p`
5. Configure TailwindCSS by updating tailwind.config.js and adding directives to index.css
6. Create a simple test component styled with TailwindCSS to verify the setup
7. Test that all dependencies are working by importing and using them in App.tsx

## 3. Set up project folder structure and code quality tools [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Establish the project architecture with appropriate directories and configure linting and formatting tools
### Details:
1. Create the following directory structure:
   - src/components/ (for UI components)
   - src/hooks/ (for custom React hooks)
   - src/utils/ (for utility functions)
   - src/services/ (for API and service functions)
   - src/store/ (for Redux store configuration)
   - src/types/ (for TypeScript interfaces and types)
   - src/pages/ (for page components)
   - src/assets/ (for static assets)
2. Install ESLint and Prettier: `npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`
3. Create configuration files (.eslintrc.js, .prettierrc)
4. Add lint and format scripts to package.json
5. Run linting to verify the setup: `npm run lint`

## 4. Implement basic routing and application shell [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Set up the routing configuration and create the main application layout structure
### Details:
1. Create basic page components in src/pages/:
   - HomePage.tsx
   - AboutPage.tsx
   - NotFoundPage.tsx
2. Create a Layout component with header, main content area, and footer
3. Set up React Router in App.tsx with routes to the created pages
4. Implement navigation links in the header component
5. Add responsive styling using TailwindCSS
6. Test navigation between pages to ensure routing works correctly
7. Implement a basic error boundary component to catch rendering errors

## 5. Configure state management and initialize Git repository [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Set up Redux store structure and initialize version control for the project
### Details:
1. Create Redux store configuration in src/store/index.ts
2. Set up a sample slice in src/store/slices/ (e.g., uiSlice.ts for UI state)
3. Wrap the application with Redux Provider in index.tsx
4. Create a simple test component that uses Redux state
5. Initialize Git repository: `git init`
6. Create a comprehensive .gitignore file (include node_modules, build directories, environment files)
7. Make initial commit with all project setup files
8. Test the complete setup by running the application and verifying all components work together
