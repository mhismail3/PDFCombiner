# PDF Combiner: Product Requirements Document

## Overview
PDF Combiner is a clean, single-page web application that allows users to easily merge multiple PDF files into a single document. The application focuses on providing a seamless user experience through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, client-side processing, and efficient PDF manipulation. By processing files directly in the browser, PDF Combiner ensures user privacy and eliminates unnecessary file transfers.

## Core Features

### PDF Upload & Management
- Drag-and-drop interface for uploading PDF files
- Alternative file browser option for selecting files
- Support for multiple file selection
- Real-time validation of file types and sizes (up to 500MB)
- Instant thumbnail generation for all PDF pages

### PDF Preview & Organization
- Visual preview of all uploaded PDF pages as thumbnails
- Drag gestures for reordering pages and documents
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation and reordering
- Page picker interface for including/excluding specific pages
- Support for selecting page ranges from source documents

### PDF Processing & Output
- Client-side PDF processing using WebAssembly
- Fallback to serverless Lambda function for large files
- Optimal compression of the output PDF
- One-click download of the combined document
- Shareable link generation (24-hour expiration)

## User Experience

### User Personas
- Office workers who need to combine reports and documentation
- Students compiling research materials and assignments
- Professionals preparing multi-source presentations or proposals
- General users organizing personal documents

### Key User Flows
1. **Upload Flow**: 
   - User arrives at site → Drag PDFs or click to browse → Files appear in the workspace
2. **Organization Flow**:
   - Preview thumbnails → Reorder pages/documents → Select/deselect specific pages
3. **Processing Flow**:
   - Click "Combine" → Progress indicator → Download combined PDF → Optional: Get shareable link

### UI/UX Considerations
- Minimal, distraction-free interface with no advertisements
- Responsive design adapting to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Dark mode support for reduced eye strain
- Real-time visual feedback for all interactions
- Clear error messages and recovery paths
- WCAG-compliant accessibility features

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- **Frontend Application**: React-based SPA with state management
- **PDF Processing Engine**: PDF.js for previews, PDF-lib.js or similar for manipulations
- **WebAssembly Module**: Core PDF manipulation functionality
- **Optional Serverless Function**: AWS Lambda for processing large files

### Data Models
- **PDF Document Object**: Metadata, page count, thumbnail URLs
- **Page Object**: Reference to source document, page number, selection state
- **User Session**: Temporary storage of processing state and document references
- **Share Link**: UUID, expiration timestamp, reference to processed file

### APIs and Integrations
- **Browser File API**: For file uploads and downloads
- **WebAssembly API**: For PDF manipulation operations
- **Web Workers**: For background processing to maintain UI responsiveness
- **Optional Cloud Storage API**: For temporary storage of large processed files
- **Optional Serverless API**: For handling large file processing

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Static web hosting (S3, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- Optional: AWS Lambda or similar for large file processing
- Optional: Temporary cloud storage with auto-expiration for shared files

## Development Roadmap

### MVP Requirements
1. Single-page web application with basic UI/UX
2. PDF upload via drag-drop and file browser
3. Basic thumbnail generation and preview
4. Simple reordering of documents (not pages)
5. Client-side PDF merging for files up to 50MB
6. Direct download of combined PDF
7. Responsive design for desktop and tablet

### Phase 2 Enhancements
1. Page-level reordering and selection
2. Keyboard shortcuts for navigation and actions
3. Page range selection functionality
4. Improved compression and optimization
5. Dark mode implementation
6. Mobile-optimized responsive design
7. WCAG accessibility compliance

### Phase 3 Features
1. WebAssembly optimization for faster processing
2. Serverless fallback for large files (up to 500MB)
3. Shareable links with 24-hour expiration
4. Enhanced page management (rotation, deletion)
5. Advanced compression options
6. Browser-based file caching for improved performance
7. Full cross-browser compatibility testing and fixes

## Logical Dependency Chain
1. Build basic SPA structure with upload functionality
2. Implement PDF parsing and thumbnail generation
3. Create document-level organization UI
4. Develop client-side PDF combination logic
5. Add download functionality
6. Implement page-level selection and organization
7. Develop WebAssembly processing optimization
8. Add serverless fallback processing
9. Implement shareable link functionality
10. Complete responsive design and accessibility features

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- **Challenge**: Client-side processing of large PDFs may freeze the browser
  **Mitigation**: Use Web Workers, progressive processing, and optional serverless offloading

- **Challenge**: WebAssembly PDF libraries may have limitations or compatibility issues
  **Mitigation**: Identify and test multiple libraries; implement fallback mechanisms

- **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent behavior across browsers
  **Mitigation**: Develop with cross-browser testing from the start; use polyfills when necessary

### Performance Considerations
- **Challenge**: Generating thumbnails for large documents may be slow
  **Mitigation**: Implement progressive loading, virtual scrolling, and optimized rendering

- **Challenge**: UI responsiveness during processing
  **Mitigation**: Background processing, clear progress indicators, and cancelable operations

### Security and Privacy
- **Challenge**: Ensuring user files remain private
  **Mitigation**: Strict client-side processing, clear privacy policies, and secure serverless implementation
